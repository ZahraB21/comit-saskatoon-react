    "An object is a composite value: it aggregates multiple values (primitive values or other objects) and allows you to store and retrieve those values by name. An object is an unordered collection of properties, each of which has a name and a value. Property names are usually strings, so we can say that objects map strings to values. This string- to-value mapping goes by various names—you are probably already familiar with the fundamental data structure under the name “hash,” “hashtable,” “dictionary,” or “associative array.” An object is more than a simple string-to-value map, however. In addition to maintaining its own set of properties, a JavaScript object also inherits the properties of another object, known as its “prototype.” The methods of an object are typically inherited properties, and this “prototypal inheritance” is a key feature of JavaScript.\n",
    "\n",
    "JavaScript objects are dynamic—properties can usually be added and deleted—but they can be used to simulate the static objects and “structs” of statically typed languages. They can also be used (by ignoring the value part of the string-to-value mapping) to represent sets of strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Any value in JavaScript that is not a string, a number, a Symbol, or true, false, null, or undefined is an object. And even though strings, numbers, and booleans are not objects, they can behave like immutable objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Objects are mutable and manipulated by reference rather than by value. If the variable x refers to an object and the code let y = x; is executed,the variable y holds a reference to the same object, not a copy of that object. Any modifications made to the object through the variable y are also visible through the variable x.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common things to do with objects are to create them and set, query, delete, test, and enumerate their properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "A property has a name and a value. A property name may be any string, including the empty string (or any Symbol), but no object may have two properties with the same name."
